# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 20, 2022
[comment]: # (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Today I decided to join the challenge. Today I did a couple of exercises of React from freecodecamp.

The last thing I learned from Markdown syntax is how to include comments. I read it from here: [stackoverflow answer on markdown comments](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4823468/comments-in-markdown).

**Thoughts:** I did finish HTML, CSS and Javascript courses. React seems to be really difficult for me at the moment. My idea is to finish the tutorials (tutorial hell?) and then try to build something from scratch and study everything again, hoping to understand the concepts better.

**Goals**: Here is a list of the things I would like to learn/master during this challenge.

* [x] HTML
* [x] CSS
* [ ] Sass
* [ ] Javascript
* [ ] Jquery
* [ ] React
* [ ] Photoshop
* [ ] Figma
* [ ] Design applied to websites

### Day 1: June 21, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 

* I finished the React exercises from freeCodeCamp: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries#react
* While working on my website ([deusdev.tech](http://deusdev.tech/)) I was able to fix a bug on the navbar. Whe the user clicked on a link (on mobile devices) the navbar stayed open. I solved this with a simple Javascript function.

### Day 2: June 22, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 

* Today I've been working on Javascript Events. I placed a couple of buttons to test the different Mouse events (click, mousedown, etc).
* I end up learning/using [Document.querySelectorAll](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelectorAll). I used this to select all buttons I was using to test the Mouse events.

### Day 3: June 23, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 

* Today I finished the Redux exercises from freecodecamp: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/#redux

### Day 4: June 24, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 

* Today I finished all exercises from freecodecamp front end dev libraries (last I finished was react and redux: [https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/#redux](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries)
* I started the Random Quote Machine: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine

**Thoughts:**
React and Redux was really hard for me and I will have to study again from another sources to help me practice more.

### Day 5: June 25, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I finished the Javascript exercises from W3schools: [https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_exercises.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_exercises.asp)

### Day 6: June 26, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I continue reading about Javascript events. I also started with [jschallenger.com](jschallenger.com).

**Thoughts:** Going back to the basics of Javascript (and then maybe Jquery) seems like a good idea before blindly jumping onto the React projects from freecodecamp.

### Day 7: June 27, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on a CodePen Challenge: https://codepen.io/challenges

I made a CodePen with the digits of the number of pi circling around the Pi symbol. Link to the CodePen: [https://codepen.io/carlosbionic/pen/ExEYMbr](https://codepen.io/carlosbionic/pen/ExEYMbr)
